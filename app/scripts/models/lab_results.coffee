  @INDICATORS:
    A1c:
      name: 'A1c'
      nameFull: 'Hemoglobin A1c'
      description: 'A1c is an index of blood sugar over the previous 3 months â€” it is related to the average blood sugar were it to be taken every 5 minutes, 24/7 for 100 days.  The actual estimated average blood sugar is shown beside A1c as eAG  Recent changes in blood sugar will not be fully reflected in A1c.  The range in non-diabetic individuals is 4.0-6.0.  For individuals with diabetes a value >8.0 usually requires intervention (change in diet, exercise, or medication).  In Type 2 diabetes a value of 4.0-6.0 is currently regarded as "Ideal", 6.1-6.9 as "optimal", 7.0-7.9 as "adequate" and >7.9 as "inadequate".  In Type 1 diabetes values <6.4 suggest frequent low blood sugar: values 6.5-7.5 are regarded as "optimal", 7.6-8.4 as "sub-optimal"&>8.4 as "inadequate".'

    eAG:
      name: 'eAG'
      nameFull: 'Estimated Average Glucose'
      description: 'This parameter is a good estimate of the average blood sugar if it were to be measured every 5 minutes 24/7 for 100 days.  It is calculated directly from A1c - the formula is eAG = 1.6xA1c-2.6.'
      maxLevel: 10.2
      isImportant: true
    LDL:
      name: 'LDL'
      nameFull: 'LDL Cholesterol'
      description: 'LDL is otherwise known as "bad" cholesterol.  The major determinant of LDL is genetics.  Other causes include low thyroid function, liver disease and kidney disease.  LDL values <2.0 are recommended for individuals with diabetes aged > 42, heart disease & stroke or with a particularly adverse family history.  "Statin" drugs are highly effective in reducing LDL.  If you are being treated with a "statin" and your LDL is above target, your physician may increase the dose or add another agent. Another alternative therapy is a medication in the PCSK9 inhibitor class.  There drugs are expensive and given by injection every 2 or 4 weeks.'

      isImportant: true
    apoB:
      name: 'apoB'
      nameFull: 'Apolipoprotein B'
      description: 'ApoB is the structural protein of the LDL particle,the cholesterol portion of which is reported as "LDL cholesterol" see above.  Apo B is a very useful indirect measure of LDL cholesterol.  BCDiabetes prefers to use apoB over LDL cholesterol because fasting is not required. ApoB values <0.8 are considered ideal for individuals with diabetes aged > 42, heart disease & stroke or with a particularly adverse family history.  "Statin" drugs are highly effective in reducing apoB.  If you are being treated with a "statin" and your apoB is above target, your physician may increase the dose or add another agent. Another alternative therapy is a medication in the PCSK9 inhibitor class.  There drugs are expensive and given by injection every 2 or 4 weeks.'

If lipemia is present in a blood sample collected in the fasting state it should be investigated.  Common causes of lipemia include overweight, inadequately controlled diabetes & alcohol excess.'

      nameFull: 'Sodium'
      description: 'Na+ is sodium which is part of common salt. The normal range is usually 135-145.  The blood level of Na+, rather than being an indicator of how much salt is in the body is more indicative of how much water is in the body.

    TSH:
      name: 'TSH'
      nameFull: 'Thyroid Stimulating Hormone'
      description: 'TSH is a screening test for thyroid function.  The normal range is 0.27-4.2.  A normal value reliably excludes abnormal thyroid function (or confirms adequate thyroid hormone replacement) in individuals whose general health is stable. TSH may be unreliable in individuals with a history of head injury, pituitary disease or being treated with anti-thyroid medication (in which cases free T4 is the preferred screening test). TSH 4.3-9.9 suggests a borderline low thyroid "hypothyroidism" (values 4.3-6.0 may also be seen in normal individuals). TSH values >9.9 suggest hypothyroidism or inadequate thyroid replacement dose and require medical attention. A TSH value <0.05 suggests an overactive thyroid "hyperthyroidism" (or excess thyroid hormone replacement) and requires medical attention. TSH values 0.05-0.26 may be seen in many conditions including other (non-thyroid) illness. An additional thyroid test, such as "free T4" may be ordered in by your doctor.'

Values in healthy adult women are one tenth male values.  A testosterone value <6 are suggestive of low testicular production.  Low values are normal during marked illness of any cause.
